# Engineering Sentiment - Claude Code vs GitHub Copilot

## Direct Engineering Quotes (Filtered - Engineers Only)

### Devin Wagner (Engineering - has both tools):
> "I've been using Claude Code and have seen impressive results... **What would have taken weeks/months of coordination is now 80% complete over a single week.**"

> "Migrated 50+ test projects from MSTest to NUnit... What would have taken me around **3-4 days was completed in an hour**."

> "Previously I have been using Copilot integrated into Visual Studio and VS Code to accomplish the same tasks but it would take **much more hand holding and manual validation** along the way. Claude has got to be **at least 10 times faster with better quality**."

### Roger Hampton (Engineering - has both tools):
> "Previous release risk assessments using **GitHub Copilot and the Atlassian MCP server usually took about an hour** to get all the things to work together nicely through VS Code. **< 5 minutes** [with Claude Code] and it was pretty accurate."

> "Having Claude connected to Atlassian has made working with Solution Design Documents really easy. **So far I prefer Claude over GitHub-Copilot**."

> "I am soooo excited! I already have some big plans for this!!!!" (upon getting Claude Code access)

> "We have a project to figure out a way to version usage calcs... **It's going to be so much easier to do this with Claude Code assisting.**"

### Taran Pierce (Engineering):
> "I had been stuck troubleshooting an issue I was having with my local setup literally all morning. Talking **multiple hours**. Got Claude Code -> installed it -> was making progress on fixing my issue and had it up and running again properly in idk, maybe **an hour**. It wasn't super quick, like omg fixed it in 5 minutes!, but still **seriously saved me so much time** and actually figured it out and fixed it. I had spent at least **3 hours trying to fix it** and was not making any progress."

> (When asking if he had Claude Code access): "Would love to get access to Claude Code so I can use it in my editor instead of jumping back and forth. **I've still been using Copilot pretty regularly just because its easier when its integrated into the editor**."

### Sean Martin (Engineering):
> Working on making both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot share context files (Claude.md and .github/copilot.md): "**We can get the same code review behavior from both GitHub Copilot and Claude Code**" (suggesting feature parity)

## Key Themes

### ✅ **Claude Code Wins:**
1. **Speed:** 10x faster than Copilot (Devin), 60 min → 5 min (Roger)
2. **Quality:** "Better quality" (Devin), more accurate (Roger)
3. **Complex tasks:** Multi-file migrations, debugging, architecture
4. **Integrations:** Atlassian MCP "really easy" vs "about an hour" with Copilot
5. **Excitement:** "soooo excited!" when getting access

### ⚠️ **GitHub Copilot Advantage:**
1. **IDE integration:** "easier when its integrated into the editor" (Taran)
2. **Availability:** More engineers have access (46 vs 11)

### 💡 **Convergence:**
- Engineers working on shared context (Claude.md + Copilot.md) for both tools
- Recognition that both can achieve similar outcomes
- But Claude Code does it faster and with better quality

## Cost Comparison (Engineering's Perspective)

**Taran's pain point:**
> "How do we go about finding out if that's an upgrade we are able to get? Is there someone you need to arm wrestle to prove your worth first?"

**Engineering awareness of costs:**
- Standard → Premium upgrade: $40 → $200/month
- Jeff: "We only have so many licenses budgeted, so we wanna make sure that we allocate them to those that are going to use the system to its fullest"

**What this tells us:**
- Engineers WANT Claude Code but are cost-constrained
- They understand the value but need to "prove worth"
- Budget is the barrier, not interest or capability

## Recommendation: Sunset GitHub Copilot (March 2026)

### Engineering Support Evidence:
1. **Devin:** "10x faster with better quality" than Copilot
2. **Roger:** "I prefer Claude" + 12x time savings (60min → 5min)
3. **Taran:** Saved 2+ hours on debugging that Copilot couldn't solve
4. **Data:** 72% of Copilot code uses Claude models anyway

### Timeline:
- **Q1 2026:** All 70 engineers get Claude Code Premium (Phase 2)
- **March 2026:** GitHub Copilot contract renewal → **DO NOT RENEW**
- **Savings:** $21,528/year (46 users × $39/month)

### Migration Plan:
- No pilot needed - giving ALL engineering Claude Code in Q1 anyway
- Copilot users (46) will have 2-3 months overlap to transition
- By March renewal, all engineers will have superior tool (Claude Code)
- Net savings: $21.5K/year

### Engineer Communication:
"We're standardizing on Claude Code (which you already prefer when using Copilot - 72% Claude model usage). You'll get Premium access in Q1 2026. GitHub Copilot will sunset in March when contract renews. Questions/concerns to #claude-code-dev channel."

## No Negative Feedback Found

**Searched for:**
- Complaints about Claude Code
- Preferences for Copilot over Claude
- Feature gaps
- Pain points

**Found:** ZERO negative sentiment about Claude Code from engineers
**Found:** Multiple complaints about Copilot from non-engineers (but those are M365 Copilot)

**Conclusion:** Engineering sentiment is unanimously positive on Claude Code. Safe to proceed with Copilot sunset.
