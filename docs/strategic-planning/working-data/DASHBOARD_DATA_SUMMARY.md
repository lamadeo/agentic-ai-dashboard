## Key Takeaways for Strategic Planning

1. **OP-000 (Claude Enterprise/Code Expansion) is FOUNDATIONAL**
   - Phase 1: Activate 26 unused Premium licenses for Engineering/Product
   - Phase 2: Expand to Sales/Marketing/CS in Q2+
   - **Blocks:** Many AI projects depend on Engineering having effective AI tools

2. **Engineering Enablement is Critical**
   - Only 42% Claude Code adoption despite 17.6x productivity advantage
   - Windows/.NET engineers lack tooling (Marketplace gap)
   - **OP-011 Marketplace expansion is prerequisite**

3. **BDR Team Can Start with M365**
   - Successfully using M365 AI Agents (BDR Cold Outreach Builder, MEDDPICC Coach)
   - OP-005 (BDR Intelligence) has **SOFT dependency** on Claude Enterprise
   - Can start with M365, migrate to Claude later for 8.4x improvement

4. **Revenue Teams Need Support**
   - Customer Success, Sales, PS all scoring <60/100
