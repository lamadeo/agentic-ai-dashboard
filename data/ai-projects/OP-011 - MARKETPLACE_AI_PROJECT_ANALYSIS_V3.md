---

## 1. Business Case & Strategic Alignment

### 1.1 Problem Statement

TechCo has invested in Claude Enterprise across the organization, but adoption and impact vary significantly:

- **Engineering teams** use Claude for coding but lack standardized workflows
- **Product teams** struggle with requirements gathering and documentation consistency
- **Operations teams** have manual processes that could be automated but lack AI expertise
- **Leadership teams** need data-driven presentations but recreate templates repeatedly
- **HR and management** lack objective tools for team assessment and talent optimization

**Core Issue:** Without curated, organization-specific tools, employees either (a) reinvent solutions repeatedly, or (b) underutilize Claude Enterprise capabilities.

### 1.2 Strategic Objectives

1. **Maximize ROI on Claude Enterprise Investment**
   - Convert license cost into measurable productivity gains
   - Reduce time-to-value for new Claude Enterprise users

2. **Accelerate AI-Driven Transformation**
   - Enable departmental "agentification" without requiring AI expertise
   - Build institutional knowledge into reusable automation

3. **Break Down Silos Through Shared Tooling**
   - Cross-functional plugin sharing (e.g., eng → product, product → sales)
   - Standardize best practices across teams

4. **Enable Human-AI Collaboration**
   - Build trust-based models for humans and AI agents working together
   - Apply context-based leadership principles (Dynamic Subordination)

5. **Reduce Vendor Dependency**
   - Own internal IP for critical workflows
   - Customize solutions for TechCo-specific needs

### 1.3 Alignment with Corporate Goals

| Corporate Goal | Marketplace Contribution | Evidence |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------|
| 30% Productivity Improvement (Company-wide) | Pre-built automation reduces task completion time | Measured via time-tracking studies |
| AI Literacy Across Organization | Low-code/no-code AI adoption via plugins | Plugin installation + usage metrics |
| Faster Time-to-Market | Engineering velocity improvements | Sprint velocity tracking |
| Cost Optimization | Reduce manual work, consolidate tooling | Cost avoidance calculations |
| Team Effectiveness | Context-based leadership optimization | Team assessment insights |
