## Project-by-Project Analysis

### OP-001: Unified Deal Intelligence Platform
**CSV Row 2 | Priority: 1 | Department: Sales**

#### The Problem (From QBR Evidence)

**Source:** [S-03, Sales Operations Problems & Recommendations]

Current win rate: **16%** vs target **24%** (33% gap)  
Primary loss reason: "Buyers don't see sufficient ROI/value"  
Sales cycle: **180 days** (target: <30 days)  

**Pain Points:**
- AEs spend 4-6 hrs/week manually researching deals
- Data fragmented: Salesforce ≠ Gong ≠ Email
- CFO asks for deal update → 1+ hour scramble to compile
- No unified view = inconsistencies and missed signals

**Quantified Impact:**
- 20 AEs × 5 hrs/week × 50 weeks × $100/hr = **$500K/year** in research time
- 40 deals/year × 8-point win rate gap × $500K avg = **$1.6M opportunity cost**

#### The Solution

**AI Approach:** RAG + Summarization + Inconsistency Detection  
**Platform:** Claude Enterprise or GPT-4 with vector embeddings  
**Integrations:** Salesforce, Gong, Outlook/Gmail

**Key Capabilities:**
1. **Automated Deal Summaries** - On-demand executive updates (solves CFO use case)
2. **Inconsistency Detection** - Flags discrepancies across systems
3. **Cross-Deal Learning** - Surfaces winning patterns from historical deals
4. **Smart Alerts** - Notifies when critical info appears anywhere

**Human-in-Loop:**
- AE reviews summaries before exec presentations
- Sales leadership approves inconsistency alerts
- Pattern insights validated before acting

#### The Numbers (From CSV)

**Investment:** $295K (6 months, 3.5 FTE peak)

Team:
- PM (0.5 FTE)
- Sr Backend Eng (1.0 FTE) 
- ML/AI Eng (0.75 FTE)
- Solutions Architect (0.25 FTE)
- QA (0.5 FTE)
- Integration Eng (0.5 FTE)

Staffing: Hybrid (FTE for PM/Architect, Contractors for ML/Backend = 30-40% savings)

**Expected Impact:**
- Win Rate: 16% → 22-24% (+5-8 points)
- Sales Cycle: 180d → 110-125d (-30-40%)
- AE Time: Save 4-6 hrs/week
- Annual Value: **$2.5M**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Win Rate Lift:
- 40 deals/year × 8-point improvement (midpoint)
- = 3.2 additional deals
- × $500K avg deal size
- = $1.6M - $2.4M revenue

Time Savings:
- 20 AEs × 5 hrs/wk × 50 weeks = 5,000 hrs/year
- × $100/hr fully loaded
- = $500K

Total Benefit: $2.1M - $2.9M
Conservative (CSV): $2.5M

12-Month ROI: ($2.5M - $295K) / $295K = 847%
Payback: 2.1 months
```

#### Critical Dependencies

**Tech (From CSV "Tech Dependencies"):**
- ✅ Salesforce API - Have access
- ⚠️ **Gong API - CRITICAL** - Not yet available, expected Q2 2026
- ✅ Email integration - Standard APIs
- ✅ LLM platform - Claude Enterprise deployed

**Org:**
- Sales Ops (Salesforce admin support)
- IT (API provisioning)
- Security (data review - 4 weeks lead time)
- CSM team (feedback on unified view)

**Blockers (From CSV):**
- Gong connector availability (Q2 2026 expected)
- Security review (4 weeks)
- Data quality in Salesforce (need cleansing sprint)

**Risk: Without Gong connector, project loses 50% of value** (can't analyze call transcripts for buying signals, objections, pain points)

#### Pilot Plan

**Scope:** 5 AEs, 10-15 active deals, 8 weeks  
**Metrics:** Time saved, summary accuracy, inconsistency detection, satisfaction

**Success Threshold:**
- 3+ hrs saved per AE per week
- 80%+ satisfaction (4/5 rating)
- Inconsistency detection 85%+ accurate

**Pilot Design:**
- Mix of top performers (2), mid-tier (2), struggling (1) AEs
- Track time before (manual) vs during (AI-assisted)
- Sales leadership blind review of quality
- Win rate comparison (pilot cohort vs baseline)

#### Decision Gates

- **Week 2:** Approve $295K budget
- **Week 8:** Pilot Go/No-Go (requires success threshold met)
- **Month 4:** Scale decision (requires 3+ point win rate improvement OR 70%+ AE adoption)

**Yellow Flags:** 2-2.5 hrs saved (below target) → extend pilot 2 weeks  
**Red Flags:** <1 hr saved OR <50% satisfaction → pause and reassess

---

### OP-002: Operations Knowledge Agent
**CSV Row 3 | Priority: 2 | Department: Operations (PS/Support/CS)**

#### The Problem

**Source:** [S-02, Ops Knowledge Management Problem]

**Current State:**
- 45 Ops staff spend **15 hrs/week** searching for information
- Knowledge fragmented: Confluence ≠ SharePoint ≠ Slack tribal knowledge
- Microsoft Copilot **FAILED:** Only 129 sessions, poor accuracy, no source attribution

**Quantified Impact:**
- 45 staff × 15 hrs/wk × 50 weeks × $75/hr = **$2.53M/year** in search time
- Inconsistent customer responses → CSAT impact
- Questions fragment across Slack (#the-rock-stars, #imperators, #ba_collabchannel)

#### The Solution

**AI Approach:** RAG with Source Attribution + Semantic Search  
**Platform:** Claude Enterprise (Confluence/Google Drive connectors **ALREADY LIVE**)

**Key Differentiator vs Copilot:** ALWAYS provides source links

**Architecture:**
```
[Confluence Ops Exchange] ─┐
[SharePoint Ops Hub]      ─┼─> [Claude Enterprise RAG] 
[Department Spaces]       ─┘         ↓
                            [Answer + Source Link]
                                     ↓
                            [Slack Integration]
```

#### Why Priority #2 (Fastest Time-to-Value)

**From CSV "Notes/Comments":**
> "Fastest time-to-value (60-90 days). Replaces failed Copilot. High confidence due to Claude's proven RAG capabilities."

**Rationale:**
1. **Infrastructure Ready:** Confluence + Google Drive connectors live (no integration CapEx)
2. **Clear Failure to Replace:** Copilot demonstrably failed → strong adoption motivation
3. **Validated Demand:** 45 people × 15 hrs/wk = obvious pain
4. **Low Technical Risk:** RAG is Claude's core strength
5. **Fast Pilot:** 4 weeks with 10-15 users

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Configure Claude Enterprise Project
- Week 2: Connect Confluence + SharePoint/Google Drive
- Week 3: Write custom instructions (tone, source attribution)
- Week 4: Pilot launch
- Week 8: Full rollout decision

#### The Numbers

**Investment:** $170K (5 months, 1.6 FTE peak)

Team:
- PM (0.3 FTE)
- Integration Eng (0.5 FTE)
- Content Manager (0.5 FTE)
- Change Management (0.3 FTE)

Staffing: FTE for PM/Content/Change, Contractor for Integration (38% savings)

**Expected Impact:**
- Search Time: 15 hrs/wk → 6 hrs/wk (-60%)
- Knowledge Accuracy: <50% → 85%+
- CSAT: +5-10 points
- Slack Questions: -40% reduction
- Annual Value: **$890K**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Time Savings:
- 45 staff × 9 hrs saved/wk (60% of 15)
- × 50 weeks = 20,250 hrs/year
- × $75/hr = $1.52M/year

Quality Improvement:
- Assume 20% of interactions have inaccurate info
- 45 staff × 20 interactions/wk × 50 weeks × 20% = 9,000 errors/year
- If CSAT hit = $100/error → $900K/year cost
- 50% reduction = $450K saved
- Conservative: Use only 1/3 = $150K

CSV shows $890K (conservative time savings at 50% adoption)

12-Month ROI: ($890K - $170K) / $170K = 523%
Payback: 2.8 months
```

#### Pilot Plan

**Scope:** 10-15 users from #the-rock-stars, 4 weeks

**Test Questions (20-30):**
- "What's the as-of date for data conversion?"
- "How do I configure multi-state feeds?"
- "What are gotchas for TPA role setup?"

**Metrics:**
- Accuracy (target: 80%+)
- Speed (sub-5 seconds)
- Satisfaction (4+/5)
- Source attribution (100% of answers)

**Success Threshold:**
- 80% accuracy
- 4/5 satisfaction
- 50%+ users say "better than asking in Slack"

- **HIGH ETHICAL RISK** - requires exec approval
- Value: 5 deals from 50 lawsuits/year IF messaging is non-exploitative

#### Financial Model

**Investment:** $540K (6 months development + 12 months operations)

Breakdown:
- Development: $295K (engineering, integration)
- Data Subscriptions: $110K/year (ZoomInfo, BuiltWith, LinkedIn Sales Nav, legal databases)
- People: $135K (1.8 FTE avg × 6 months)

**Return:** $20.4M pipeline (conservative, 50% BDR adoption)

Assumptions:
- 15 BDRs on team (Lucas Melgaard confirmed)
- 50% adopt AI tools consistently
- Lead acceptance rate: 60% (vs 40% baseline)
- SQL conversion: 25% (vs 15% baseline)
- Close rate: 20% (same as baseline but better quality)

Pipeline Math:
```
Total Annual Signals: ~1,000 (across all 6 engines)
× 60% acceptance = 600 leads worked
× 25% SQL conversion = 150 SQLs
× 20% close rate = 30 closed deals
× $800K avg deal = $24M revenue

Conservative (50% adoption): $24M × 0.85 = $20.4M
```

**ROI:** ($20.4M - $540K) / $540K = **3,678%**
**Payback:** 10 days (yes, days)

**Comparison to Alternatives:**

| Option | Annual Cost | Pipeline | Cost per $1M |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Hire 5 BDRs | $455K | $2M | $228K |
| Buy Leads | $200K | $4.5M | $44K |
| **BDR AI** | **$110K** | **$20.4M** | **$5.4K** |

**10x more cost-efficient than hiring BDRs**

#### Phased Rollout

**Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Quick Wins**
- Launch: OP-016 (Tech Stack) + OP-011 (Champion Tracker)
- Pilot: Lucas + 4 BDRs
- Deliverable: 10+ AI leads, Salesforce enrichment working
- Gate: 60% adoption, 50% acceptance rate

**Phase 2 (Days 30-90): Expansion**
- Add: OP-018 (Trigger Events) + OP-017 (Leave Volume)
- Scale: 10 of 15 BDRs
- Deliverable: $300K+ pipeline generated
- Gate: $300K pipeline, 25%+ SQL conversion

**Phase 3 (Days 90-180): Full Platform**
- Add: OP-012 (Hiring) + OP-015 (Compliance Risk)
- Scale: All 15 BDRs
- Deliverable: $1.5M+ pipeline, 2+ closed deals
- Gate: 75% BDR quota attainment (up from 65%)

**Phase 4 (Days 180-270): Advanced (OPTIONAL)**
- Add: OP-014 (Lawsuit) IF legal/exec approved
- Deliverable: $2M+ pipeline
- Gate: 2,000%+ program ROI

#### Ethical Considerations - OP-014 Lawsuit Tracker

**Concern:** Could appear as "ambulance chasing"

**Mitigation:**
- Position as "compliance risk management" not "I saw you got sued"
- Messaging focus: "Prevent future issues" not "fix current problem"
- Executive approval on ALL messaging templates
- Pilot with 3 senior BDRs only
- Legal review of outreach approach
- Customer feedback monitoring (any complaints = pause)

**Recommendation:** Launch OP-014 ONLY after OP-011-018 prove value. If pilots generate complaints, sunset OP-014 (lose $2.5M but preserve brand).

### OP-004: AI Proposal & Business Case Generator
**CSV Row 4 | Priority: 3 | Department: Sales**

#### The Problem

- AEs spend 8-12 hrs per proposal on research and formatting
- Inconsistent business cases don't demonstrate ROI
- Primary loss reason: "Buyers don't see sufficient ROI/value"
- 40 proposals/year × 10 hrs = 400 hrs = $30K in AE time

#### The Solution

**AI Approach:** Template-based LLM + ROI Modeling + Content Assembly

**Key Capabilities:**
1. Business Case Creation: Pulls customer data, industry benchmarks → generates ROI
2. Personalized Proposals: Uses Gong insights (pain points) → tailored presentation
3. Compliance Gap Analysis: NLP on discovery → maps to solutions
4. Dynamic Pricing Guidance: Rule-based + ML suggestions

**Gong Dependency:** Project delivers 70% value without Gong (Salesforce-only), 100% value with Gong connector (adds discovery insights)

**Shared ROI Engine with OP-017:** $20K savings from not duplicating leave volume calculation logic

#### The Numbers

**Investment:** $185K (5 months, 2.1 FTE)
**Annual Value:** $1.6M
**ROI:** 612%
**Payback:** 2.4 months

Value Breakdown:
- Win rate: +3-5 points = 1.6 deals × $500K = $800K
- Time savings: 40 proposals × 8 hrs × $100/hr = $32K
- Opportunity cost: AE can sell more = additional value
- Total: $1.6M (per CSV)

### OP-006: Professional Services Time-to-Value Accelerator
**CSV Row 6 | Priority: 5 | Department: PS**

#### The Problem (From QBR)

- Implementation delays from staffing strains
- Bug backlogs slow implementations
- Manual processes time-intensive
- Time-to-Value critical for CSAT

#### The Solution

**AI Approach:** AI-Assisted Configuration + Automated Playbooks + Intelligent Provisioning

**Synergy with OP-002:** Builds automation ON TOP of Operations Knowledge base

```
OP-002 (Q1): Centralized Knowledge Base
↓
OP-006 (Q3): Automation leveraging that knowledge
↓
Combined: Knowledge access + Automated execution
```

#### The Numbers

**Investment:** $180K (6 months, 2.0 FTE)
**Annual Value:** $1.2M (capacity increase OR time savings)
**ROI:** 445%
**Payback:** 3.2 months

**Portfolio Acceleration:** Enables OP-001, 002, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009 = $322K time savings

**Cost Avoidance:** $375K over 3 years if teams build duplicates

#### The Numbers

**Investment:** $415K (vs original $285K)
**Why $130K more:**
- OP-008 Integration: +$20K (QA SME)
- SME Pool: +$45K (cross-functional plugins need domain experts)
- Analytics Platform: +$10K (track WAU, NPS, hours saved)
- CI/CD Automation: +$15K (security scanning, testing)
- Marketplace Summit: +$15K (internal event Q4)
- Expanded Training: +$5K (bi-weekly demos, video tutorials)

**Annual Value:** $1.69M (150 users × 3 hrs/wk × $75/hr)
**ROI:** 306% (1-year), 492% (3-year)
**Payback:** 10.1 months

**Scenario Analysis:**
- Conservative (60% adoption, 2 hrs/wk): $1.01M, 145% ROI
- Base (67%, 3 hrs/wk): $1.69M, 306% ROI
