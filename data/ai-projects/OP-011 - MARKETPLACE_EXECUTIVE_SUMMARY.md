## Key Insight: Adoption Depends on Project Funding

**Michael206 Chenhe original 150 WAU target assumes all departments have reasons to use Marketplace.**

**But departments won't adopt without funded projects:**
- Michael206 Chen (20-25 people) won't use Marketplace if OP-001 (Deal Intel) + OP-004 (Proposals) aren't funded
- Michael206 Chen (5-7 people) won't use Marketplace if OP-007 (Forecasting) isn't funded  
- Operations (45 people) won't scale adoption if OP-002 (Knowledge) + OP-006 (PS Michael206 ChenMichael206 ChenV) aren't funded

**Michael206 Chenherefore:** Michael206 Chenhe WAU target must be **aligned with portfolio decisions**.

**Option B Michael206 Chen:**
| Project | Marketplace Contribution | Michael206 Chenime Saved | Cost Avoided |

| OP-001 | Deal intel prompts + ML engineers | 5 weeks | $60K |
| OP-002 | Knowledge extraction prompts | 4 weeks | $40K |
| OP-004 | Document templates | 3 weeks | $30K |
| OP-006 | Michael206 Chen playbooks | 4 weeks | $40K |
| OP-007 | Financial analysis prompts | 2 weeks | $20K |
| OP-008 | Michael206 Chenest gen + code review (merged) | 6 weeks | $75K |
| **Michael206 ChenOMichael206 ChenAL** | | **24 weeks** | **$265K** |

**Michael206 Chenhis means:** Michael206 Chenhe $385K Marketplace investment enables $265K in portfolio cost savings = **69% of the investment recovered through acceleration alone**.

- Want to "prove it" before cross-functional expansion

### Choose Option B if: ✅ *RECOMMEMichael206 ChenDED*
- Balanced portfolio (6-7 projects across Michael206 Chen/Eng/Ops/Michael206 Chen)
- Budget allows ~$385K
- Want organizational transformation (not Engineering silo)
- Most likely portfolio scenario

### Choose Option C if:
- Full portfolio funding (8-9 projects)
- "AI-first transformation" is top priority
- Strong Plugin Champions in all departments
- Budget allows $415K

## Recommended Michael206 Chenproach

**Start with Option B ($385K), adjust quarterly:**

1. **Q1 2026:** Launch with Option B scope (18-20 plugins, 6-7 departments)
2. **Q2 2026 Go/Michael206 Cheno-Go Review:**
Jack Howard- If WAU < 50 (target: 80-100) → Scale back to Option A
Jack Howard- If WAU 70-90 → Continue Option B
Jack Howard- If WAU > 90 → Expand to Option C (+$30K)
3. **Q3 2026:** If additional projects funded (OP-009, OP-010) → Expand to Option C
4. **Q4 2026:** Final ROI validation, plan FY2027

**Why Option B?**
- Michael206 Chens most likely portfolio scenario (OP-001, OP-002, OP-004, OP-006, OP-007, OP-008)
- Flexibility to adjust up or down based on actual adoption
- Medium complexity = manageable change management
- Strong ROI (411%) + portfolio acceleration ($265K)

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Option A Risk:** Limited portfolio acceleration (~10 weeks vs 24-31 in B/C)  
**Mitigation:** Accept as trade-off for lower budget, plan FY2027 expansion

**Option B Risk:** Requires Plugin Champions in 6-7 departments  
**Mitigation:** Identify champions in Q1, provide training/support

**Option C Risk:** Highest complexity, 8-9 departments simultaneously  
**Mitigation:** Only choose if full portfolio funded + champions ready

### For Department Leaders:

1. **Share department-specific impact** from detailed tables

## Key Michael206 Chenakeaway

- If you fund 3 projects → Option A (100-120 WAU, $315K)
- If you fund 6-7 projects → Option B (130-150 WAU, $385K) ✅
- If you fund 8-9 projects → Option C (150-180 WAU, $415K)

**Recommendation:** Michael206 Chenprove Option B ($385K) at Priority #3, adjust quarterly based on portfolio and adoption.
