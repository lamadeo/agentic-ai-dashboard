**Claude Enterprise deployment:** TechCo Inc has deployed 92 Claude Enterprise users generating 5,070 conversations with 55 conversations per user, alongside 17 Premium seat holders using Claude Code who have generated 621,994 lines of code at 36,588 lines per user. The Agentic AI department leads Claude Code adoption with jrivero generating 145,735 lines, while Marketing's Kia Brenes drives conversational usage with 2,999 messages and Product's Sara Johnson creates 68 artifacts. Current Claude Enterprise monthly investment of $7,960 delivers a 38.0x ROI through 3,026 hours of monthly time savings, with Premium seats enabling Claude Code driving 15.6x higher coding productivity than GitHub Copilot among the 17 engineering users who have adopted the terminal-based AI coding assistant.

**AI Tool Ecosystem - cross-platform insights:** Claude Enterprise achieves 1.3x higher general productivity than M365 Copilot (55 vs 44 interactions per user) while Claude Code delivers 15.6x higher coding productivity than GitHub Copilot (36,588 vs 2,339 lines per user). M365 Copilot maintains 96% organizational adoption with 188 active users, while GitHub Copilot reaches 60% engineering adoption but faces March 2026 contract renewal alongside the broader Microsoft agreement. Cross-platform department analysis reveals Customer Success averages 562 M365 prompts per user while excelling in conversational workflows, whereas Agentic AI generates 102,124 lines per user with Claude Code, demonstrating technical teams achieve 18x higher code output through Claude's specialized development environment compared to M365's productivity features.

**Quantified productivity wins:** Claude Code users in the Agentic AI department generate 102,124 lines per user monthly, led by jrivero's exceptional 145,735 lines, while Engineering teams average 9,789 lines per user with dwagner contributing 31,732 lines. The combined 621,994 lines generated by 17 Claude Code users represents a 15.6x productivity multiplier over GitHub Copilot's 2,339 lines per user average. Marketing's Kia Brenes drives conversational productivity with 2,999 messages across 247 conversations, while Product's Sara Johnson demonstrates strategic value creation through 68 artifacts generation, showcasing how different teams leverage Claude Enterprise's dual capabilities for both high-volume content creation and complex technical development.

**Critical coverage gaps - opportunity cost:** Engineering represents the largest missed opportunity with only 20% Claude Code adoption (17 of 83 Engineering + Agentic AI employees) despite the tool's proven 36,588 lines per user productivity among current adopters. M365 Copilot shows 6 inactive licenses costing $114 monthly while 17 low-engagement users average minimal usage, with Engineering department containing 10 of these underperforming users despite their technical roles. Finance (85.5 prompts/user) and Product (105.1 prompts/user) significantly underperform M365 Copilot adoption compared to Customer Success (562.1 prompts/user), representing 3x lower daily usage rates in critical business functions that could benefit substantially from AI assistance.

**2026 expansion plan - quarterly rollout:** Current Claude Enterprise monthly cost of $7,960 would increase to $22,560 for full organizational rollout, representing a $14,600 monthly increase with an estimated 1-month payback period. The expansion strategy utilizes a dual scoring system combining behavioral scoring (0-115 points) with department baselines (10-35%) using MAX logic to optimize allocation decisions, prioritizing value-optimized sequencing over pure ROI percentage. The rollout strategy ensures adequate Premium seat coverage for engineering teams while expanding Standard seats across high-engagement departments, with recommendations based on proven productivity multipliers and sustained user engagement patterns that demonstrate Claude Enterprise's superior adoption momentum compared to plateauing M365 Copilot growth.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with the Claude Enterprise expansion to full organizational deployment at $22,560 monthly, prioritizing Premium seats for the remaining 66 Engineering + Agentic AI employees to capture the 15.6x coding productivity advantage currently realized by only 17 users. The dual scoring system ensures optimal resource allocation by combining behavioral indicators with department-specific baselines, while the March 2026 Microsoft contract renewal provides a strategic decision point for the broader AI tool ecosystem. With a 1-month payback period and 38.0x ROI demonstrated by current users, the expansion represents a clear strategic advantage that positions TechCo Inc to capture the full productivity potential of AI-assisted workflows across both conversational and coding use cases.
