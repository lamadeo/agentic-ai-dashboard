# Project Goals & Strategic Context

## Executive Problem
- Multiple AI tools deployed (Claude Enterprise, M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT)
- Mixed ROI results, some duplicative tools adding cost with little value
- Executives cannot differentiate between AI products:
  - Claude Enterprise vs Claude Code
  - GitHub Copilot vs Claude Code
  - M365 Copilot vs Claude Enterprise
  - When to use which tool?
- Cannot justify premium tool costs to board/leadership

## AI Tool Sprawl Challenge
- **M365 Copilot**: Entire org has access (~300 employees) as part of Microsoft license
- **Claude Enterprise**: Only 85 licenses (28% of org)
- **GitHub Copilot**: 46 engineers (15% of org)
- **Question**: Why pay for Claude/Copilot if everyone has M365 Copilot?
- **Answer Needed**: Data-driven proof that specialized tools deliver superior value

## Target Audience
- Executive leadership team
- Board of directors
- CFO (budget decisions)
- CTO/VP Engineering (technical decisions)
- Department heads
- Enablement team

## Success Metrics

### Budget Justification (Initial)
- Adoption rates by department
- Lines of code generated (productivity proxy for coding tools)
- Conversations/usage metrics (productivity proxy for general AI)
- Cost per user vs value per user
- ROI calculations for expansion scenarios
- Engineer sentiment and preference data

### Continuous Optimization (Ongoing)
- **Track value & ROI post-spend**: After budget approval, continuously measure actual ROI
- **Improve adoption**: Identify departments/users with low adoption, recommend interventions
- **Enhance business outcomes**: Surface use cases that drive business value, replicate across org
- **Sentiment analysis**: Continuously monitor Slack channels for feedback, pain points, success stories
- **Adaptive recommendations**: AI-generated insights on how to improve deployment strategy

## Strategic Decisions Enabled

### Budget & Allocation Decisions
1. Which departments get Claude Premium vs Standard licenses?
2. Should we sunset GitHub Copilot? (Data-driven recommendation from insights)
3. What's the ROI for full org rollout of Claude Enterprise?
4. How do M365 Copilot and Claude Enterprise complement vs compete? (AI-determined from insights)
5. Which AI tools should we consolidate/eliminate? (AI recommendations based on usage patterns)

### Continuous Improvement Decisions
6. How do we increase adoption in underutilized departments?
7. Which use cases drive the most business value? (Surface from Slack sentiment)
8. Are our initial business rules still optimal? (AI analyzes and recommends adjustments)
9. Which teams need more training/enablement?
10. What blockers are preventing adoption? (Identified from sentiment analysis)

## Organizational Context
- ~300 employees across Engineering, Product, Sales, Service, GTM, Support, Finance, HR, Marketing
- **Current AI Licenses**:
  - Claude Enterprise: 85 total (12 Premium @ $200/mo, 73 Standard @ $40/mo)
  - GitHub Copilot: 46 users @ $39/mo = $1,794/mo ($21.5K/year)
  - M365 Copilot: Org-wide (included in Microsoft 365 license)
- **Engineering**: 70 total engineers (need to expand Claude Code Premium to all)

## Key Insights from Data

### Coding Tools
**Engineers choose Claude models 72% of the time** when using GitHub Copilot with multi-model choice. This validates Claude as the preferred AI for engineering work.

**Claude Code users are 7.5x more productive** than GitHub Copilot users (27,650 lines/user vs 3,700 lines/user).

### General Productivity
Need to analyze M365 Copilot usage data to compare:
- Adoption rates (% of org using it)
- Use cases (Word, Excel, Teams, PowerPoint)
- Value delivered vs Claude Enterprise (chat, projects, artifacts, analysis)

## Vision: "Agentic Organization"
TechCo Inc aims to become an agentic organization where AI tools enable everyone to work at higher levels. Claude Enterprise is positioned as the core platform for this transformation, with specialized tools (Claude Code) for power users.

## The Dashboard Mission

This is an **interactive executive dashboard** that serves as both a reporting tool and an optimization engine. It:

1. **Justifies budget allocation** (initial deployment)
   - Current ROI of deployed tools
   - Projected ROI of expansion
   - Cost savings from consolidation

2. **Continuously monitors value** (post-deployment)
   - Real-time adoption tracking
   - Actual ROI vs projected ROI
   - Usage patterns and trends

3. **Analyzes sentiment & use cases** (from Slack)
   - Success stories from #claude-code-dev, #claude-enterprise
   - Pain points and blockers from #ai-collab
   - Cross-functional insights from #techco-thrv, #engineering, #technology
   - Real-world value stories from employees

4. **Generates AI-driven recommendations** (strategic guidance)
   - Tool positioning (complementary vs competitive) based on insights, not prescriptive rules
   - Business rule optimization (e.g., "Consider expanding Premium to Sales team based on usage patterns")
   - Adoption improvement strategies (e.g., "Engineering team X has low adoption - recommend targeted training")
   - Consolidation opportunities (e.g., "GitHub Copilot shows 72% Claude preference - recommend sunset")

## Budget Constraints
Leadership understands value but needs to "prove worth" before expanding licenses. Once approved, need to continuously demonstrate value and optimize deployment strategy.
